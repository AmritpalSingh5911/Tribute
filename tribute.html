        <p id="cont1"> Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the general theory of relativity,
            one of the
            two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).Einstein's work is also known for its influence
            on the philosophy of science.Einstein is best known in popular culture for his mass–energy equivalence
            formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation").He received the 1921 Nobel Prize
            in Physics for his "services to theoretical physics", in particular his discovery of the law of the
            photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory.</p>
        <p id="cont2">1879 Born to Hermann Einstein (a featherbed salesman) and his wife Pauline in Ulm, Germany.
            1884 Receives his first compass around this time, inspiring a lifelong quest to investigate mysteries of the

            term on his own and then follows his family to Italy.
